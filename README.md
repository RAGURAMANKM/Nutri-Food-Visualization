# Nutri-Food-Visualization
This project is simply designed by Machine Learning and Visualize that data by protein,Calories and etc.,
NutriClass is a machine learning project that classifies food items into multiple categories using nutritional attributes such as calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, sugar, and other related features.
The project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
This project involves,
Define the problem of classifying food items using nutritional values.
Collect the food nutrition dataset in CSV format.
Import required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Display sample rows to understand food attributes.
Check dataset size, data types, and column information.
Analyze class distribution of food categories.
Handle missing values using median imputation.
Remove duplicate records from the dataset.
Separate numerical and categorical features.
Encode categorical features using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler.
Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train Logistic Regression classifier.
Train Decision Tree classifier.
Train Random Forest classifier.
Train K-Nearest Neighbors and SVM classifiers.
Evaluate all models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Visualize confusion matrices and compare model performance.
